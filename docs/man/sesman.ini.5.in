.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsesman.ini\fR consists of several sections. Each section starts with
the section name in square brackets, followed by a list of
\fIparameter\fR=\fIvalue\fR lines. Following sections are recognized:

.TP
\fB[Globals]\fR
Global configuration

.TP
\fB[Logging]\fR
Logging subsystem

.TP
\fB[Sessions]\fR
Session management

.TP
\fB[Security]\fR

.TP
\fB[SessionVariables]\fR
Environment variables for the session

.LP
All parameters and values (except for file names and paths) are case
insensitive, and are described in detail below. If any parameter is
specified more than once, the last entry will be used. Options specified
outside their proper section will be \fIignored\fR.

.SH "GLOBALS"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Globals]\fR section.

.TP
\fBListenPort\fR=\fIpath-to-socket\fR
UNIX domain socket for xrdp-sesman(8) to listen on.
.PP
.RS
The default value of this setting is 'sesman.socket'.
.PP
An absolute path can be specified by starting this parameter with a '/'.
In this instance, the system administrator is responsible for ensuring
the socket can only be created by a suitably privileged process.
.PP
If the parameter does not start with a '/', a name within
@socketdir@ is used.
.RE

.TP
\fBEnableUserWindowManager\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR, this option enables user
specific startup script. That is, xrdp-sesman will execute the script
specified by \fBUserWindowManager\fR if it exists.

.TP
\fBUserWindowManager\fR=\fIfilename\fR
Path of the startup script relative to the user's home directory. If
present and enabled by \fBEnableUserWindowManager\fR, that script is
executed instead of \fBDefaultWindowManager\fR.

.TP
\fBDefaultWindowManager\fR=\fIfilename\fR
Full path or relative path of the default startup script used by xrdp-sesman
to start a session.  If the path is not a full path, it will be resolved as
relative path to \fI@xrdpconfdir@\fR. If not specified, defaults to
\fI@xrdpconfdir@/startwm.sh\fR.

.TP
\fBReconnectScript\fR=\fIfilename\fR
Full path or relative path if the script which executed when users reconnects
to the existing session. If the path is not a full path, it will be resolved as
relative path to \fI@xrdpconfdir@\fR. If not specified, defaults to
\fI@xrdpconfdir@/reconnectwm.sh\fR.

.SH "LOGGING"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Logging]\fR and \fB[ChansrvLogging]\fR 
sections.

.TP
\fBLogFile\fR=\fIfilename\fR
Log file path. It can be either absolute or relative. If not specified,
defaults to \fI./sesman.log\fR. If set to \fB<stdout>\fR, log will go to
stdout. Use for debugging only\fR

It is ignored in the [ChansrvLogging] section
since the channel server creates one log file per display and instead uses the
following log file naming convention \fIxrdp-chansrv.${DISPLAY}.log\fR

.TP
\fBLogLevel\fR=\fIlevel\fR

\fBWARNING\fR, \fBWARN\fR or \fB2\fR \- Logs warnings and error messages.

\fBINFO\fR or \fB3\fR \- Log errors, warnings and informational messages.

\fBDEBUG\fR or \fB4\fR \- Log everything. If xrdp-sesman is compiled in
debug mode, this options will output many more low\-level messages.

.TP
\fBEnableSyslog\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR, this option enables logging to
syslog.

.TP
\fBSyslogLevel\fR=\fIlevel\fR
Logging level for syslog. It can have the same values as \fBLogLevel\fR.
Defaults to \fBDEBUG\fR.

.TP
\fBEnableConsole\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR, this option enables logging to
the console (ie. stdout).

process id in all log messages. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.

.SH "SESSIONS"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Sessions]\fR section.

.TP
\fBX11DisplayOffset\fR=\fInumber\fR
The first X display number available for xrdp-sesman. This prevents
xrdp-sesman from interfering with real X11 servers. If not specified,
defaults to \fI10\fR.

.TP
\fBMaxSessions\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the maximum number of simultaneous sessions. If not set or set to
\fI0\fR, unlimited session are allowed.

.TP
\fBMaxDisplayNumber\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the maximum number which can be assigned to an X11 $DISPLAY. The
default is compatible with IANA TCP port allocations. If you are not
allowing TCP connections to your X servers you may safely increase this
number.

.TP
\fBKillDisconnected\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR, every session will be killed
within \fBDisconnectedTimeLimit\fR seconds after the user disconnects.
This setting currently only works with xorgxrdp sessions.

.TP
\fBDisconnectedTimeLimit\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the time limit for \fBKillDisconnected\fR to a value greater than 60.
Values less than 60 are to be overridden with 60.
This setting currently only works with xorgxrdp sessions.

.TP
\fBIdleTimeLimit\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the time limit (in seconds) before an idle session is disconnected.
Idle means no keyboard inputs and no mouse moves/clicks here.
If set to \fI0\fR, idle sessions will never be disconnected by timeout.
This works only with xorgxrdp sessions. Moreover, xorgxrdp must be v0.2.9 or later.

.TP
\fBPolicy\fR=\fI[Default|Separate|{UBDI}]\fR
Session allocation policy. Used to decide when to allocate a
new session. Set to one of the following values:
.br

.RS
.HP 12
\fBDefault\fR -   Currently the same as "UB" for all session types
.HP 12
\fBSeparate\fR -  All sessions are separate. Sessions can never be rejoined,
and will need to be cleaned up manually, or automatically by setting other
sesman options.
.P
Alternatively combine one-or-more of the following options
.HP 4
\fBU\fR - Sessions are separated per user
.HP 4
\fBB\fR - Sessions are separated by bits-per-pixel
.HP 4
\fBD\fR - Sessions are separated by initial display size
.HP 4
\fBI\fR - Sessions are separated by IP address
.RE

.IP
Note that the \fBU\fR and \fBB\fR criteria cannot be turned
off. \fBDisplaySize\fR refers to the initial geometry of a connection,

Only the users belonging to the specified group are allowed to login on
terminal server. If unset or set to an invalid or non\-existent group,
login for all users is enabled.

.TP
\fBTerminalServerAdmins\fR=\fIgroup\fR
\fIThis option is currently ignored!\fR Only members of this group can
have session management rights.

.TP
\fBRestrictOutboundClipboard\fR=\fI[all|none|text|file|image]\fR
If set to \fBall\fR, will restrict the clipboard
outbound from the server, to prevent data copied inside the xrdp session

\fByes\fR - an alias of \fBall\fR.

.TP
\fBAlwaysGroupCheck\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR or \fByes\fR, require group membership even
if the group specified in \fBTerminalServerUsers\fR doesn't exist.

.TP

\fBXorgNoNewPrivileges\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
Only applicable on Linux. If set to \fB0\fR, \fBfalse\fR or \fBno\fR, do
not use the kernel's \fIno_new_privs\fR restriction when invoking the Xorg
X11 server. The use of \fIno_new_privs\fR is intended to prevent issues due
to a setuid Xorg executable. However, if a kernel security module (such as
AppArmor) is used to confine xrdp, \fIno_new_privs\fR may interfere with
transitions between confinement domains.

.TP
\fBSessionSockdirGroup\fR=\fIgroup\fR
Sets the group owner of the directories containing session sockets. This
is normally the GID of the xrdp process so xrdp can connect to user sessions.

.SH "X11 SERVER"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Xvnc]\fR and
\fB[Xorg]\fR sections.

.TP
\fBparam\fR=\fIstring\fR
Multiple \fIparam\fR lines are supported. This first line specifies the
path to the X11 server executable. Following lines specify command line
arguments passed to the X11 server.

.SH "CHANSRV"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Chansrv]\fR section.

.TP
\fBFuseMountName\fR=\fIstring\fR
Directory for drive redirection.
Created if it doesn't exist. If not specified, defaults to \fIxrdp_client\fR.
If first character is not a '/', this is relative to $HOME.
.P
.RS
The following substitutions are made in this string:-
    %U - Username
    %u - Numeric UID
    %d - Numeric display number (ex 10)
    %D - Display environment variable (ex :10.0)
    %% - Percent character
.HP 3
1) The directory path permissions MUST be configured correctly by
the system administrator or the system itself - xrdp-chansrv will not
do this for you (although it will create the final directories owned by
the user).
.HP 3
2) The desktop may not automatically display a link for the redirected
drive. To fix this, consult the docs for your chosen desktop.
.RE

.TP
\fBFileUmask\fR=\fImode\fR
Additional umask to apply to files in the \fBFuseMountName\fR directory.
The default value of 077 prevents other users on the system from reading
files on your redirected drives. This may not be appropriate for all
environments, and so you can change this value to allow other users to
access your remote files if required.

.TP
\fBEnableFuseMount\fR=\fI[true|false]\fR
Defaults to \fItrue\fR.
Set to \fIfalse\fR to disable xrdp-chansrv's use of the FUSE system
feature, even if it has been built with this feature enabled.
.P
.RS
Setting this value to \fIfalse\fR will disable the following application
features:-
.P
-  drive redirection
.P
-  copying-and-pasting of files
.RE
.TP
\fBUseNautilus3FlistFormat\fR=\fI[false|true]\fR
Defaults to \fIfalse\fR.
Set to \fItrue\fR to make file copy-paste compatible with Nautilus from
GNOME 3 versions later than 3.29.92. Do not use this for any other reason.

This setting will be removed in a later version of xrdp, when GNOME 3 is
no longer supported.

.TP
\fBSoundNumSilentFramesAAC\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the \fInumber\fR of silent frames which are sent to client before close
message is sent, when AAC is selected. If set to 0, no silent frame is sent.
If not specified, defaults to \fI4\fR.

.TP
\fBSoundNumSilentFramesMP3\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the \fInumber\fR of silent frames which are sent to client before close
message is sent, when MP3 is selected. If set to 0, no silent frame is sent.
If not specified, defaults to \fI2\fR.

.TP
\fBSoundMsecDoNotSend\fR=\fInumber\fR
Sets the duration(msec). Sound data is not send to client during \fInumber\fR
millisecond(s) after close message is sent, when AAC/MP3 is selected.
If set to 0, all the data is sent. If not specified, defaults to \fI1000\fR.

.SH "SESSIONS VARIABLES"
All entries in the \fB[SessionVariables]\fR section are set as
environment variables in the user's session.
